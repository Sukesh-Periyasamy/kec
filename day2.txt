Learning Objectives
By the end of today, you will:
✅ Understand what an Operating System does
✅ Understand OS architecture (Kernel vs User)
✅ Learn virtualization concepts (Hypervisors)
✅ Install Windows 11 in VirtualBox (Hands-on)
✅ Configure & troubleshoot a Virtual Machine

What Happens When You Press Power?
1
BIOS/UEFI
➡️
2
Bootloader
➡️
3
Kernel
➡️
4
Drivers
➡️
5
Login
🤔 Think:
Does Windows load first or BIOS?

==============================

--- SLIDE 4 ---
What is an Operating System?
OS
= Bridge between User & Hardware
👉 Manages hardware & software resources
👉 Provides User Interface (UI) for you
Examples:
Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS

==============================

--- SLIDE 5 ---
Core Responsibilities of OS
Process Management:
Running and scheduling programs
Memory Management:
Allocating and managing RAM
File System:
Organizing and storing data
Device Drivers:
Communicating with hardware
Security:
Managing user accounts and permissions

==============================

--- SLIDE 6 ---
Without an OS?
❌ No application can run
❌ No memory management possible
❌ No file access or storage
❌ No intuitive user interface
OS is
mandatory
for system
operation.

🧠 Kernel (The Core)
⬇️
💻 Hardware (CPU, RAM)

==============================

--- SLIDE 8 ---
Kernel vs User Mode
User Mode
Applications run here
Limited hardware access
Safe:
Crash = App closes
VS
Kernel Mode
Full hardware access
Core system control
Critical:
Crash = Blue Screen
Why separation?
→ To ensure Security & Stability.

==============================

--- SLIDE 9 ---
What is Virtualization?
Virtualization
= Running multiple Operating Systems on one
physical machine simultaneously.
Example setup:
One Physical Laptop →
Windows (Host)
+
Linux (Guest)
+
Kali (Guest)

==============================

--- SLIDE 10 ---
What is a Hypervisor?
Hypervisor
= Software that creates & manages Virtual
Machines.
Allocates CPU, RAM, & Disk space
Controls VM execution like a conductor
Type 1 (Bare Metal)
Runs directly on hardware.
Used in Enterprise Severs.
Type 2 (Hosted)
Runs as an app on OS.
VirtualBox
, VMware Workstation.

==============================

--- SLIDE 11 ---
Why Industry Uses Virtualization
☁️ Cloud Computing
Powering AWS, Azure, GCP
🧪 Safe Testing
Sandbox for new apps
🚀 DevOps
Consistent CI/CD pipelines
🔒 Cybersecurity
Malware analysis labs
📉 Efficiency
Run 10 servers on 1 machine

==============================

--- SLIDE 12 ---
Virtual Machine Components
A VM is made of software-emulated hardware:
🧠
vCPU
Virtual Processor
💾
vRAM
Virtual Memory
💿
vDisk
Virtual Hard Drive
🌐
vNIC
Virtual Network Card

==============================

--- SLIDE 13 ---
System Requirements for Lab
Minimum
8GB RAM
100GB Free Storage
Two-Core CPU
Virtualization Enabled
Recommended
16GB RAM
SSD Storage (Faster)
Quad-Core CPU
Dedicated Graphics

==============================

--- SLIDE 14 ---
Step 0: Enable Virtualization
1️⃣ Check Task Manager
Performance → CPU → "Virtualization: Enabled"
2️⃣ If Disabled: Enter BIOS
Intel:
Enable "Intel VT-x"
AMD:
Enable "SVM Mode"
Restart your computer to access BIOS (usually F2, F10, or Del key).

==============================

--- SLIDE 15 ---
Step 1: Install VirtualBox
Download
➡️
Run Installer
➡️
Allow Drivers
➡️
Finish
Keep default settings. Say "Yes" to network interfaces warning.

==============================

--- SLIDE 16 ---
VirtualBox Interface Overview
✨
New:
Create a fresh VM
⚙️
Settings:
Configure Hardware
💾
Storage:
Manage ISO/Disks
▶️
Start:
Power on the VM

==============================

--- SLIDE 17 ---
Step 2: Create New VM
Click "New" and configure:
Name:
Windows 11 Lab
Type:
Microsoft Windows
Version:
Windows 11 (64-bit)
If "64-bit" is missing, your BIOS Virtualization is OFF.

==============================

--- SLIDE 18 ---
Step 3: Allocating RAM
Minimum Safe
4096 MB (4 GB)
Recommended
8192 MB (8 GB)
Golden Rule:
Never allocate more than 50% of your host PC's total RAM. Green zone
only!

==============================

--- SLIDE 19 ---
Step 4: Allocating CPU
Minimum
2 Cores
Smoother
4 Cores
More cores = Faster installation and smoother performance.

==============================

--- SLIDE 20 ---
Step 5: Virtual Disk
File Type:
VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)
Storage Strategy:
Dynamically Allocated
Size:
80 GB (Don't worry, it grows as needed)
Dynamic vs Fixed:
Dynamic starts small and grows. Fixed takes all space immediately
but is slightly faster. We use Dynamic.

==============================

--- SLIDE 21 ---
Step 6: Attach ISO File
Settings
➡️
Storage
➡️
Empty Install CD
➡️
Select ISO File
Think of the ISO as a digital DVD you are
inserting into the VM.

==============================

--- SLIDE 22 ---
Step 7: Installation
Start VM
➡️
Press Key
➡️
Language
➡️
Install Now
➡️
Custom Install
Select "Custom: Install Windows Only" when asked.

==============================

--- SLIDE 23 ---
⚠️ The "Can't Run Windows 11" Error
"This PC can’t run Windows 11"
The Reason:
Windows 11 requires a security chip called
TPM 2.0
and
Secure Boot
, which our generic VM doesn't have yet.
Don't panic! We will bypass this like hackers. 🕵️‍♂️

==============================

--- SLIDE 24 ---
Step 8: TPM Bypass (The Hack)
Press
Shift + F10
to open CMD
⬇️
Type
regedit
and hit Enter
⬇️
Go to:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup
⬇️
New Key: Name it
LabConfig
⬇️
New DWORDs:
BypassTPMCheck=1
BypassSecureBootCheck=1

==============================

--- SLIDE 25 ---
Installation Complete! 🎉
After restarts, you will setup:
🌍
Region & Keyboard
👤
User Account
🖼️
Welcome Desktop

==============================

--- SLIDE 26 ---
Step 9: Guest Additions
Crucial Step!
This installs the drivers for the VM.
✅ Full Screen Resolution
✅ Drag & Drop Files
✅ Shared Clipboard (Copy/Paste)
✅ Smooth Mouse Movement
Menu → Devices → "Insert Guest Additions CD Image" → Run installer in VM.

==============================

--- SLIDE 27 ---
Network Modes Explained
NAT
Default & Safe.
VM shares host's IP address. Good for browsing.
Bridged Adapter
Advanced.
VM gets its own IP from router. Best for servers.
Host-Only
Isolated.
Only talks to Host. No Internet. For analysis.

==============================

--- SLIDE 28 ---
📸 Snapshot Feature
Snapshot
= A "Save Game" for your Computer.
It records the exact state of the VM (Disk + RAM).
When to use Snapshots?
⚠️ Before installing unknown software
⚠️ Before editing system registry
⚠️ To create a clean "base state" for labs

==============================

--- SLIDE 29 ---
Common Errors & Fixes
⚠️ Missing 64-bit
Cause:
Virtualization disabled in BIOS.
Fix: Enable VT-x / SVM
⛔ Black Screen
Cause:
Low video memory or 3D acceleration bug.
Fix: Increase Video Memory
🐢 Slow VM
Cause:
1 Core / Low RAM assigned.
Fix: Give 2+ Cores & 8GB RAM
🌐 No Internet
Cause:
Network adapter misconfigured.
Fix: Switch to NAT or Bridged

Ready for the Quiz?

==============================

--- SLIDE 33 ---
🧠 Quick Quiz: Hypervisor
What software manages and runs Virtual Machines?
A) Kernel
B) Hypervisor
C) Bootloader
D) Device Driver
Reveal Answer
✅ (B) Hypervisor
A hypervisor (like VirtualBox) acts as the platform that creates and
runs virtual machines on top of the physical hardware.

==============================

--- SLIDE 34 ---
🧠 Quick Quiz: Kernel Mode
Which mode provides full, unrestricted access to hardware?
A) User Mode
B) Safe Mode
C) Kernel Mode
D) Dark Mode
Reveal Answer
✅ (C) Kernel Mode
Kernel Mode is the privileged ring of the CPU where the OS core runs.
Restricting apps to User Mode prevents them from crashing the whole system.

==============================

--- SLIDE 35 ---
🧠 Quick Quiz: Snapshots
Why is taking a Snapshot important?
A) Takes a photo of you
B) Speeds up the Internet
C) Saves exact system state
Reveal Answer
✅ (C) Saves exact system state
Snapshots are your "Undo" button. They allow you to revert the VM back
to a previous healthy state if an installation fails.

==============================

--- SLIDE 36 ---
🧠 Quick Quiz: Network Modes
Which network mode gives the VM its own unique IP from the router?
A) NAT
B) Bridged Adapter
C) Host-Only
Reveal Answer
✅ (B) Bridged Adapter
Bridged mode connects the VM directly to your physical network, making
it look like a distinct device separate from your host computer.
