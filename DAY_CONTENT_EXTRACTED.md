## Slide 52
🧠 Think Like an Engineer What is the MOST important job of a PSU? (A) High wattage (B) RGB (C) Clean, stable power (D) Silent fan Reveal Answer ✅ (C) Clean, stable power High wattage doesn't matter if the power is "dirty" or unstable. A PSU's primary job is to protect your expensive components from electrical damage. It doesn't make performance; it protects it.

## Slide 53
PSU Wattage Reality Wattage = maximum output PC draws only what it needs Higher watt ≠ higher bill

## Slide 54
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Does higher watt PSU increase electricity bill? Reveal Answer ❌ No Your PC only draws the power it actually needs from the PSU. A 1000W PSU doesn't use 1000W of electricity unless the components demand it. Capacity is not consumption.

## Slide 55
PSU Quality & 80+ Ratings Bronze Good Gold Best value Platinum Premium Efficiency = less heat, longer life

## Slide 56
🧠 Think Like an Engineer What does 80+ Gold actually mean? Reveal Answer ✅ Higher Efficiency An 80+ Gold rating means the PSU is highly efficient at converting wall power to PC power. This results in less wasted energy (heat), a longer lifespan, and often quieter operation. Efficiency saves heat, not performance.

## Slide 57
PSU Cables Explained 24-pin → motherboard 8-pin → CPU PCIe → GPU SATA → storage ⚠️ Never mix PSU cables

## Slide 58
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Can you mix PSU cables from different brands? (A) Yes (B) No Reveal Answer ❌ No Internal pin layouts on the PSU side are not standardized. Using the wrong cable can send the wrong voltage to your components and kill your whole PC instantly. Never mix cables.

## Slide 59

## Slide 60
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Which upgrade improves boot time the MOST? (A) More RAM (B) Faster CPU (C) SSD instead of HDD (D) Better GPU Reveal Answer ✅ (C) SSD instead of HDD The Operating System loads directly from your storage device. Replacing a slow mechanical HDD with a fast SSD is the most impactful upgrade for system responsiveness. Speed starts where data lives.

## Slide 61
Storage Types HDD Slow, mechanical SATA SSD Fast NVMe SSD Extremely fast

## Slide 62
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Which storage has NO moving parts? (A) HDD (B) SATA SSD (C) NVMe SSD (D) B and C Reveal Answer ✅ (D) B and C Both SATA and NVMe SSDs are solid-state drives, meaning they use flash memory and have no moving parts. HDDs are mechanical and have spinning platters. Moving parts mean waiting.

## Slide 63
Storage Speed Comparison HDD ~100 MB/s SATA SSD ~500 MB/s NVMe SSD 3000+ MB/s

## Slide 64
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Does faster storage increase FPS in games? Reveal Answer ❌ No (mostly) FPS depends primarily on your CPU and GPU. Storage speed affects how fast the game and its levels load, but not how fast the game engine renders frames. Storage decides how fast you start, not how fast you run.

## Slide 65
Cooling & Thermals Air Cooling Liquid Cooling Thermal Throttling Heat limits performance

## Slide 66
🧠 Think Like an Engineer What happens if CPU gets too hot? (A) Faster performance (B) Permanent damage immediately (C) Slower performance (D) Nothing Reveal Answer ✅ (C) Slower performance Modern CPUs will reduce their clock speeds (thermal throttling) to generate less heat and protect themselves from damage. Heat doesn't break performance — it limits it.

## Slide 67
Monitor Basics 📏 Size 🖼️ Resolution 🔄 Refresh rate 🎨 Panel type Monitor defines experience

## Slide 68
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Which upgrade changes how smooth the PC feels the MOST? (A) Bigger monitor (B) Higher resolution (C) Higher refresh rate (D) Curved screen Reveal Answer ✅ (C) Higher refresh rate A higher refresh rate (e.g., 144Hz vs 60Hz) makes every motion on the screen look significantly smoother. Your eyes feel the refresh rate even before they notice the resolution.

## Slide 69
HDMI vs DisplayPort HDMI TVs, basic use VS DisplayPort High refresh, gaming Cable choice matters

## Slide 70
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Why do gamers prefer DisplayPort? Reveal Answer ✅ Performance Standards DisplayPort generally supports higher refresh rates and resolutions compared to older HDMI versions. Your choice of cable can literally limit what your monitor is capable of displaying.

## Slide 71
Ports & Cables USB versions ≠ same speed USB-C ≠ guaranteed display Thunderbolt = high capability

## Slide 72
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Does USB-C always mean fast data + display? (A) Yes (B) No Reveal Answer ❌ No USB-C is just the physical shape of the connector. The actual capability (speed, charging, display out) depends on the protocol running behind it (USB 2.0, 3.2, Thunderbolt, etc.). Shape is not speed.

## Slide 73
Internal Cables (Reality) 🔌 SATA data vs power 🔲 Front panel connectors ❄️ Fan headers 🌈 RGB vs ARGB Most PC issues are cable issues

## Slide 74
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Most PC build issues come from? (A) Faulty CPU (B) Bad GPU (C) Software bugs (D) Loose / wrong cables Reveal Answer ✅ (D) Cables Front panel connectors, power cables, and fan headers are the most common points of failure in a new build. Always check your cable connections before panicking about faulty hardware.

## Slide 75
What is an OS? OS = Operating System ⚙️ Controls hardware 📱 Runs applications 🔗 Interface between user & machine

## Slide 76
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Can hardware work without an OS? Reveal Answer ✅ Yes (but useless) Hardware will power on and perform basic POST checks, but without an OS, the user has no way to interact with the system or run applications. The OS gives the hardware a functional voice.

## Slide 77
OS Installation Flow BIOS → Boot → Install → Drivers Skipping drivers = wasted performance

## Slide 78
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Why does a fresh PC feel slow after OS install? Reveal Answer ✅ Missing Drivers A fresh OS install only has generic drivers. You must install specific hardware drivers to enable full performance and features. The OS runs the hardware, but drivers unlock its true potential.

## Slide 79
BIOS & Drivers ⚙️ BIOS initializes hardware 🚀 Drivers unlock performance ⚡ XMP / EXPO boosts RAM speed

## Slide 80
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Why does RAM run slower by default? Reveal Answer ✅ Safe Settings Most high-speed RAM requires enabling XMP (Intel) or EXPO (AMD) in the BIOS to reach its advertised speed. Default settings are chosen for maximum safety, not maximum speed.

## Slide 81
Laptop vs Desktop Laptop ✓ Portable ⚠️ Power-limited ⚠️ Limited upgrade VS Desktop ✓ Powerful ✓ Upgradeable ✓ Better value

## Slide 82
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Why can a desktop beat a laptop with same CPU name? Reveal Answer ✅ Power & Cooling Desktops have much higher power limits and superior cooling solutions. Even with the "same" chip name, the desktop version has the freedom to run at higher speeds for longer. Same name, different freedom.

## Slide 83
Final Engineering Mindset Balance > Specs System > Single Part Logic > Marketing "There is no best computer — only the right one."

## Slide 84
🧠 Think Like an Engineer Is there a 'best' computer? Reveal Answer ❌ No There is no single "best" computer—only the right computer for the specific task at hand. Engineering is all about choosing the right trade-offs for your needs.
